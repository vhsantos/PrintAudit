Page Log File Format

The page_log file lists the total number of pages (sheets) that are printed. By default, each line contains the following information:

    printer user job-id date-time total num-sheets job-billing
      job-originating-host-name job-name media sides

For example the entry for a two page job called "myjob" might look like:

    DeskJet root 1 [20/May/1999:19:21:06 +0000] total 2 acme-123
      localhost myjob na_letter_8.5x11in one-sided

The PageLogFormat directive in the cupsd.conf(5) file can be used to change this information.
The printer field contains the name of the printer that printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this field will contain the name of the printer that was assigned the job.

The user field contains the name of the user (the IPP requesting-user-name attribute) that submitted this file for printing.

The job-id field contains the job number of the page being printed.

The date-time field contains the date and time of when the page started printing. The format of this field is identical to the data-time field in the access_log file.

The num-sheets field provides the total number of pages (sheets) that have been printed on for the job.

The job-billing field contains a copy of the job-billing or job-account-id attributes provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if neither was provided.

The job-originating-host-name field contains the hostname or IP address of the client that printed the job.

The job-name field contains a copy of the job-name attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.

The media field contains a copy of the media or media-col/media-size attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.

The sides field contains a copy of the sides attribute provided with the IPP Create-Job or Print-Job requests or "-" if none was provided.
